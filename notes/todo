recheck voltage needs - done
do test with AAA batteries - in progress started sunday 12/10
   	seems to be shifting color after 48 hours.  we are down to around 2.7v
	definitely wrong colors by wednesday evening 12/13
	2 AA cells down around 2.6v
	wish we'd done a voltage/time plot.

test with CR2032
  specified life is at a 15K ohm load to 2.0v
  	    	 so we'll likely stop way earlier
  at 10mA load, quickly drops to 2.5v, falls off further after 20-25 mAh
     	  so maybe could get 10 usable hours.
  CR2032 really not great above 2mA
  test it anyway.  unknown-condition CR2032 from drawer.
  start around 11pm wed dec 13 at 2.8v connected to attiny+leds
  	some color shift almost right away
  	11 am thursday: down to 2.51v,  pretty much just red/green
  try again with a new CR2023
      start 9:45 pm wed dec 20  -  3.01v
      10:15pm wed dec 20 - 2.703v    some color shift
      10:48pm wed dec 20 - 2.68v     colors not much worse 
      11:20pm wed dec 20 - 2.67v
      11:45pm wed dec 20 - 2.66v
      12:20am thur dec 20 - 2.655v
      10:40am thurs dec 20 - 2.55v pretty close to only red+green

      6.5 hours to 2.6v .  probably useful if we do
      	  voltage-dependent color correction

can the attiny85 adc measure its own power supply?
    no, not without an external voltage divider and using up a pin.

look into kicad 7
     os upgrade  DONE, got 7.0.9

work us through building the schematic
  update 1:  kicad 7
  	 add bypass capacitors
	 add power symbols

  update 2: hook up the rest of the power.  maybe walk someone else through

  update 3: CPU to ICSP and LEDs

  update 4: power
  	 battery holders
	 switch
	 reverse protection diode

  update 5: accessory connectors
  	 analog in
	 digial I/O
	 ws2812 daisy-chain output
